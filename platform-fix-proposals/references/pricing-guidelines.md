## Pricing Philosophy

Based on Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers:

1. **Price on value, not time** — We guarantee £100k+ savings
2. **Charge 10-20% of value** — £100k savings = £30-50k justified
3. **~40-45% gaps between tiers** — Feels logical, not jarring
4. **Bonuses, not discounts** — "Free month" devalues; bonuses add value
5. **Full risk reversal** — Buyer cannot lose money
6. **Goal framing** — "Ideal for" describes dreams, not deficiencies
