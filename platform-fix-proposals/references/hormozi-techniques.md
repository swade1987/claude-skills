## The Value Equation

```
VALUE = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort Required)
```

### Maximise Numerator

**Dream Outcome**: What they actually want
- "Teams ship features, not fight fires"
- "Your phone doesn't ring on holiday"
- "New teams productive in days, not weeks"

**Perceived Likelihood**: Why they should believe it
- Track record: "53 platform transformations"
- Case study with specific metrics
- Guarantees with refund terms

### Minimise Denominator

**Time Delay**: How fast they get results
- "6 weeks, not 6 months"
- "Quick wins by Week 2"

**Effort Required**: How much work THEY do
- "We do the work"
- "We diagnose AND fix"

## Grand Slam Offer Components

### 1. Value Stack

List components with standalone values. Total exceeds price by 25-40%.

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Audit | £7,500 |
| Roadmap | £3,000 |
| Implementation | £15,000 |
| Training | £5,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **£30,500** |
| **PRICE** | **£25,000** |

### 2. Bonuses

Extras that cost little but have high perceived value.

**Good**: Health checks (1 hour), template packs (already created), priority access (free)

**Bad**: Free consulting days (high cost), discounts (devalues)

**Always add expiry.**

### 3. Scarcity

Believable limits on availability.

**Good**: "2 Foundation clients per quarter" (capacity), "1 slot for Q1" (time)

**Bad**: "Only 1 spot ever!" (unbelievable)

### 4. Urgency

Time pressure to act.

- **Cost of delay**: "Every month costs CHF 15,000"
- **Bonus expiry**: "£4,000 bonuses expire February 28"
- **Slot allocation**: "Goes to waitlist if not confirmed"

### 5. Risk Reversal

Transfer risk from buyer to seller.

| Type | Example | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| Unconditional | Full refund if not satisfied | High |
| Conditional | Refund if no £100k savings found | Medium |
| Performance | Continue free until done | Low |

**Standard guarantees:**
1. Waste identification by Week 2 or refund Audit fee
2. Complete in 6 weeks or continue free
3. 40-70% reduction or continue until achieved

### 6. Reason Why

Explain why offer is good. Prevents suspicion.

**Good**: "Expanding in Swiss market, want flagship case study"

**Bad**: "We're desperate" (low value signal)

### 7. Price Anchoring

Three options, middle recommended.

| Option | Price | Psychology |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Audit | £7,500 | "Too limited" |
| Foundation | £35,000 | "Just right" ★ |
| Momentum | £59,000 | "Makes Foundation reasonable" |

## Proposal Applications

### Cost of Waiting Section

Quantify monthly pain:

```
Productivity loss: £7,500-15,000/month
+ Delayed delivery: Unquantified
+ Risk: Security exposure
= ANNUAL: £90,000-180,000+
```

Then: "Foundation (£35,000) pays for itself in 4-5 months."

### Why This Offer Section

Two reasons max. Be specific.

1. **Market**: "[Client] is ideal for Swiss market entry"
2. **Timeline**: "We have availability in [month]. That's rare."

Close: "This isn't discounted work. It's full-price work at a moment when the fit is perfect."

### Guarantee Section

Format consistently:

**GUARANTEE [N]: [Name]**
[Promise] — or [remedy].
